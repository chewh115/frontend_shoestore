# Your Task

For this assessment, we will be creating a new React frontend and reusing our backend from Django ReST Framework: APIs in a Nutshell

Frontend

Create a new react app. You'll want to use something like Facebook's Create React App (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. Please check the documentation, because this project's documentation is frequently updated. You can use either npm or yarn as your package manager, it's up to your personal preference.

This react app will be relatively simple. We don't need to worry about using Redux, and we just need to create one component to handle everything we need.

Requirements

Uses fetch (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. to get data from your Django Rest Framework API â†’ https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
